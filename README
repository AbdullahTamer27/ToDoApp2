HI MY NAME IS ABDULLAH AND THIS IS MY TO DO APPLICATION BAISICALLY IT IS A LIST YOU CAN ADD TO OR REMOVE FROOM OR CHECK IF THE TASKS YOU HAVE TO HELP YOU BE MORE ORGANIZED
I USED ANGULAR AND BOOTSRAP5 TO MAKE AND DESIGN THE APP
USED ALL KINDS OF THINGS I LEARNED IN THIS INTERNSHIP LIKE FORMS/INPUT FIELDS/STYLING USING BOOTSTRAP/STYLE AND CLASS BINDING/CUSTOM VALIDATORS ETC...
I AM PROUD OF IT EVEN THO IT IS A SIMPLE APPLICATION BECAUSE AT THE START OF THE INTERNSHIP I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO WRITE HTML CODE LET ALONE USING ANGULAR FRAMEWORK
I AM NOT GOING TO STOP HERE I AM GOING TO EXPAND THE PROJECT FURTHER ADDING EDIT BUTTONS AND SEARCH FIELD AND SEE WHERE I CAN GO FROM HERE
THANK YOU..
